									<h2><a href="#">Profile<br />
									Summary</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Sameer a 16 yr old High School Student, Climate Activist, Innovator, sociopreneur and
Researcher from Kanpur, India. My insatiable curiosity to learn new things and my passion for reading have certainly given me the necessary skills for gaining knowledge and applying it in various contexts, I believe in creating change through action and by creating and implementing unique practical solutions such as my recent work in my Startup Kaizel Tech where we developed a project called EMP Drone.

Alongside my work in STEM  i have also actively worked in multiple disciplines and fields. For instance i have participated in Psychological  Interdisciplinary Research Internships and even ranked in top 50 in a plethora of thousands of applicants from multiple countries. With a passion for International relations i have also actively Participated in Youth Dialogue's, UN Conferences and MUN's in various capacities ranging from Delegate to Chairperson of a Committee. 

While on my journey to address and advocate about Environmental issues and Climate change, I have also created an Initiative and multiple clubs to act on both  grassroot and International level.
